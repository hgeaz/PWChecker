This password checker takes in a user input and determines if the typed password is a strong password. A string password has at least one 
special character, at least 1 number, and much be between 12 and 18 characters long! A user can make a new password by instantiating a new 
PasswordChecker object and calling the 1 paramater constructor with a string of their password. They then call the method, GetStrength() to check 
their password strength!


Special Characters count as "!@#$%^&*()"

To use, download the project from the Master branch and import it into your c# IDE. Then, create a new class that references PwChecker project.

Warnings: Does not encrypt password, and does not save password to any database. This is a mere experiment for a class project and is some very weak
code.

This program should be used responsibly and carefully and should not interfere with illegal activity.
